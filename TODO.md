## epic-TSE-0001: Foundation Services & Infrastructure

### üèóÔ∏è Milestone TSE-0001.1a: Go Services Bootstrapping
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create Go service directory structure following clean architecture
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (REST and gRPC)
- [x] Basic structured logging with levels
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Dockerfile for service containerization
- [x] Load component-specific .claude configuration

**BDD Acceptance**: All Go services can start, respond to health checks, and shutdown gracefully

### üîó Milestone TSE-0001.3b: Go Services gRPC Integration
**Status**: Phase 1 in Progress (Following custodian-simulator-go pattern)
**Priority**: High

**Tasks** (Following proven TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle):
- [x] **Phase 1: TDD Red** - Create failing tests for all gRPC integration behaviors
- [ ] **Phase 2: Infrastructure** - Add Redis dependencies and update .gitignore for Go projects
- [ ] **Phase 3: gRPC Server** - Implement enhanced gRPC server with health service, metrics, and graceful shutdown
- [ ] **Phase 4: Configuration** - Implement configuration service client with HTTP caching, TTL, and type conversion
- [ ] **Phase 5: Discovery** - Implement service discovery with Redis-based registry, heartbeat, and cleanup
- [ ] **Phase 6: Communication** - Create inter-service gRPC client manager with connection pooling and circuit breaker
- [ ] **Phase 7: Integration** - Implement comprehensive inter-service communication testing with smart skipping
- [ ] **Phase 8: Validation** - Verify BDD acceptance and complete milestone documentation

**Implementation Pattern** (Replicating custodian-simulator-go success):
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Configuration client, service discovery, gRPC clients
- **Presentation Layer**: Enhanced gRPC server with health service
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests with smart dependency skipping, integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, circuit breaker patterns, comprehensive logging

**BDD Acceptance**: Go services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1a (Go Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

**Reference Implementation**: custodian-simulator-go (‚úÖ COMPLETED) - Use as pattern for architecture and testing

### üè™ Milestone TSE-0001.5a: Exchange Account Management (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Foundation for trading

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Account creation and management system
- [ ] Multi-asset balance tracking (BTC, ETH, USD, USDT)
- [ ] Account query APIs
- [ ] Basic risk checks (sufficient balance validation)
- [ ] Account audit trail

**BDD Acceptance**: Trading Engine can create accounts and check balances

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3b (Go Services gRPC Integration)

---

### üè™ Milestone TSE-0001.5b: Exchange Order Processing (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core trading functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Order placement API (market orders only)
- [ ] Simple order matching engine (immediate fill at market price)
- [ ] Order status reporting and lifecycle management
- [ ] Transaction history and audit trail
- [ ] REST API following production trading patterns

**BDD Acceptance**: Trading Engine can place orders and receive confirmations

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.5a (Exchange Account Management), TSE-0001.4 (Market Data Foundation)

---

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12b: Trading Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] End-to-end trading workflow testing
- [ ] Order placement through settlement validation
- [ ] Risk monitoring during trading validation
- [ ] Performance validation under normal operations

**BDD Acceptance**: Complete trading flow works end-to-end with risk monitoring

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.8 (Trading Engine), TSE-0001.6 (Custodian)

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Order Types**: Start with market orders, design for limit orders later
- **Production API**: REST endpoints that trading engines will use
- **Audit API**: Separate endpoints for chaos injection and internal state
- **Matching Engine**: Simple immediate execution, prepare for order book
- **Risk Checks**: Basic balance validation, extensible for complex rules
- **Chaos Ready**: Design for controlled failure injection
